## 1. Pull the respitory
```
cd /path/to/your/directory  
git clone https://github.com/Corleone-Yang/Smart_API_Manager_with_LLM.git
```
## 2. Set the Environment
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_key'
```

## 3. Run the APP
As I have upload the .venv environment, you don't need to create .venv bu your own.
Hence, you can directly run this APP.
```
flask run
```
Note: All the APIs are samples. In the app, we only use their routes and have not actually imported them.
